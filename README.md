# horus-models
- c++/python classes (java interfaces are not reliable in terms of updates)
- horus machine learning models
- features extraction, clustering, etc. for horus-core algorithms

Overview
- to compute probability for each NER class, based on image processing
- SIFT/SURF + dependency parsing as features
- to find optimal theta for search engine
