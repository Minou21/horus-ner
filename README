HORUS is a probabilistic named entity recognition (NER) algorithm based on image processing and multi-level machine learning. Currently supports the identification of classical named-entity types (LOC, PER, ORG). It has been designed to minimize the existing gap of NER on short-texts.  

* horus-models
  1. c++/python classes (java interfaces are not reliable in terms of updates)
  2. horus machine learning models
  3. features extraction, clustering, etc. for horus-core algorithm

* Overview
  1. to compute probability for each NER class, based on image processing
  2. SIFT/SURF + dependency parsing as features
  3. to find optimal theta for search engine

* OpenCV Issues
  1. there are many issues on java/python bindings with regard to coding SIFT (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/5667 among others) 
  2. matlibplot does not work on macosx if you don't create a file at /Users/[your-user]/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc and add the following line ```backend: TkAgg```

* Datasets
  1. PASCAL VOC 2007
  2. Caltech-101 - http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/Caltech101/
  3. Flickr
  4. 15 scene categories
  5. Graz

(REMIND -> check the distribution of classes for LOC and train separared models, then use DecisionTree to get the best model.
